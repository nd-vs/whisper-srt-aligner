# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-20

- Folder/season mode with configurable filename masks and recursive discovery.
- Episode pairing preview, per-file audio-language selection or explicit track index.
- Sequential episode queue, completed/total progress and per-episode status.
- Existing output is skipped by default; replacement requires confirmation.
- Cancelling stops the current worker and prevents the next episode from starting.
  Completed outputs are retained; failed episodes do not stop the rest of the queue.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-20

- A Windows GUI for one media/SRT pair with audio-track selection, CPU-first defaults,
  background processing/cancellation, English/Russian labels and report shortcuts.
- Staged output publication protects source files and previous completed results.
- A portable Windows x64 ZIP with Python bundled and a reproducible PyInstaller
  build recipe; FFmpeg and models remain external.
- The interface follows the system language (Russian or English fallback),
  with a manual language switch. Existing CLI commands remain available.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-20

- Simpler CPU-first setup, a controlled before/after demo, and separate technical documentation.
- UTF-16 decoding now requires a byte-order mark, preventing some Windows-1252
  subtitle files from being silently decoded as UTF-16. Includes regression coverage.
- Clearer accuracy/review guidance; retained cue count is not presented as timing accuracy.
- Constrain PyAV to `<19` while released faster-whisper 1.2.x passes the removed
  `metadata_errors` argument. A fresh installation otherwise fails to decode audio.

The CLI default model and complete-mode behavior are unchanged. No GUI, automatic
MKV muxing, or cross-language alignment is added.

## 0.1.0

- Initial CLI: audio inspection, recognition, SRT alignment, complete mode, batch
  episode matching, reusable transcripts, JSON/HTML reports.
